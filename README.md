# This is a recruiting task

**1. The task is to create a two-way drop-down list with any number of nests. If the group is of the radio type, only one list on a given level can be expanded, if of the checkbox type, any number can be expanded.**

**2. Collapsing a list does not collapse nested lists.**

**3. The line on the left representing the hierarchy goes exactly to the middle of the first line of the element, regardless of the font size.**

**4. It should be rolled out and rolled up smoothly.**

**5. For better readability, even lines of a given level should have a different background than the odd ones.**

**6. The data source for the list is to be JSON, the model to be proposed.**
